# CordovaPlatformProject
Experimental API for cordova. Currently it's a fairly thin wrapper around cordova-lib that provides an object oriented promises based API for managing cordova apps.

For usage example see the [cordova-api-example](https://github.com/kamrik/cordova-api-example/blob/master/README.md) app.
